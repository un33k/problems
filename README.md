Problems
========

This repository is a small collection of problems along with few possible solutions.
I used these for interviewing and ultimately hiring interns. (Masters Students)

It was **OK** for them to say `I don't know`, provided they had the capacity & eagerness to learn.
So if you end up using these to hire your staff, you have to make sure you follow the above rule.

If you ask me the same questions now, I have to go and look up my own materials first. :)
