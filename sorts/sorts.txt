Insertion Sort:
------------------------------------
- Properties
    Stable
    O(1) extra space
    O(n^2) comparisons and swaps
    Adaptive
        - O(n) time when nearly sorted
    Very low overhead

Heap Sort:
------------------------------------
- Properties
    O(1) extra space
    O(n * lg(n)) time
    Not stable
        - original ordering is lost during the heap creation, which comes first
    Not really adaptive
        - doesn't takes advantage of existing order in its input
